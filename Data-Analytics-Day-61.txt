Data Analytics Lessons

ðŸ”¹ Lesson 1: Big Data Workflow (ETL)
=======================================
Summary:
Big data pipelines usually follow ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) steps.
Extract: from multiple sources (databases, APIs, sensors)
Transform: cleaning, aggregating, enriching
Load: into warehouses or lakes (Snowflake, Hadoop, etc.)

Example:
E-commerce ETL: Pull customer orders â†’ clean missing values â†’ load into Redshift for dashboards.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 2: Spark MLlib Basics
===================================
Summary:
MLlib = Sparkâ€™s machine learning library for distributed ML.
Classification, regression, clustering
Scales to millions of rows
Integrates with Spark SQL

Example:
Train a logistic regression model on millions of clickstream logs directly in Spark.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 3: Clustering (K-Means in Spark)
=============================================
Summary:
Clustering groups similar data points without labels.
K-Means is most popular (partition into K groups)
Uses distance metrics like Euclidean
Good for segmentation

Example:
Bank segments customers into 3 groups:
High spenders
Moderate users
Low spenders


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 4: Anomaly Detection in Big Data
=============================================
Summary:
Detecting outliers in huge datasets helps identify fraud, errors, or unusual behavior.
Methods: Z-score, Isolation Forest, DBSCAN
Spark MLlib scales anomaly detection to billions of rows

Example:
Telecom company flags sudden network spikes as anomalies to detect system issues early.



ðŸ”¹ Lesson 5: Case Study â€“ IoT Sensor Analytics
=============================================
Summary:
Steps:
-------
ETL pipeline ingests sensor data from IoT devices
Spark MLlib clusters usage patterns
Anomaly detection identifies faulty devices
Dashboards show trends in real-time

Example:
Smart factory detects 5% of machines overheating â†’ triggers preventive maintenance.
